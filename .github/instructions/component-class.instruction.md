# Component class file coding standards

## General rules

- Use '#' as a prefix for private class members instead of underscore.
- Keep the ordering of class members: private properties, super, ctor, public properties, protected properties, public methods , protected methods, private methods, static methods.
- Use 'inject' function instead of ctor DI
